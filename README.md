# Undercooked
## wut
Undercooked is a text-based co-op cooking game made for the [August 2018 Demake Jam](https://itch.io/jam/demake-jam).
## license
Undercooked is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) because yes. It has dependencies on several node modules that are mostly MIT licensed.
## why
Demake Jam. I already said that.
## building
I don't know how all this node.js stuff works yet, yo. Clone the repo, then do like an "npm install" or something I guess? I'll have a better answer here later. The only real dependency is [discord.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.io) for the discord integration. oh yeah, did I mention this is a discord bot? because it is. you're probably going to want to have [discord](https://discordapp.com/) if you want to do much with this.

Once the thing is built, you also need to create a discord bot through discord's whole setup thing for that, and then put an *auth.json* file in the root of the directory with the right token in it.

I'll probably update this to be more helpful later.
## running
Invite your bot into your server, set up their permissions and whatever, then just run *node bot.js* to get this bad boy started. Type "INIT" in the channel you want the game to start in, and then you're good to go. Type "!HELP" for more information from the bot itself.
## want to make changes?
The game isn't even done yet hold your horses yo.
