# Undercooked Instruction Manual
---------------------------------

What is Undercooked?
----------------------
Undercooked is a text-based co-op cooking game, where you must work together with other players to cook delicious meals at your very own restaurant!

How do I start the game?
--------------------------
Say <INIT> to become the host. After that, follow the prompts to select the number of players, then start the game after enough players have joined. The number of players you specify is a maximum, so you can still start a 4-player game after only 2 people have joined!

How do I play?
---------------
Well, as a reminder, you can say <!HELP> at any time to see this message again! Once the game is started, only people actually playing the game can do this.

The following commands are available to you:
< grab > - pick up an item 
* synonyms: take, get, acquire, procure, obtain
* format: grab item from place (number)
* examples: "grab tomato from dispenser", "take tomato from table 2"

< drop > - put down whatever you're currently holding item
* synonyms: put, place, plop, set, deposit, position
* format: put on place (number)
* examples: "put on cutting board 1", "drop on table"
* notes: you can just write "drop" to put it on the floor - anyone else in the room can pick it up then! items on the floor may be trampled, though.

< plate > - put whatever item you're holding on a plate so it's ready to serve!
* format: plate (on place (number))
* examples: "plate", "plate on table", "plate on table 2"
