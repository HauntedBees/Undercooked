# Undercooked Instruction Manual
---------------------------------

What is Undercooked?
----------------------
Undercooked is a text-based co-op cooking game, where you must work together with other players to cook delicious meals at your very own restaurant!

How do I start the game?
--------------------------
Say <INIT> to become the host. After that, follow the prompts to select the number of players, then start the game after enough players have joined. The number of players you specify is a maximum, so you can still start a 4-player game after only 2 people have joined!
